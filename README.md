# Unity-DOTS-Tower-Defense
A tower defense mockup made with Unity DOTS (ECS Pattern)

![alt text](https://github.com/RenanDresch/Unity-DOTS-Tower-Defense/blob/master/Readme/cover.jpg?raw=true)

In this example you'll find how to apply unity DOTS on a super simple "tower defense game" (it's a simulation actually).

This example contains lots of bursted code.
Some examples on how to use translations to convert from local to world space.

Some examples on how to communicate between system and monobehaviour classes (check the vfx proxy system and the nexus death system).

There's also an example of physics triggering (Trigger folder within ECS).

I plan to add more features (pathfinding, controlls, gameplay), and make everyhting bursted as we get more pure ECS features like : animations, sound, vfx and ui.
